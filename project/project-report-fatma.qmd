# Project report

Thank you for uploading your identified data to the course material. I have created this file for you to work on your data using the code you have learned as part of the course. I have added some data cleaning steps as the first code-chunk. I hope this will help you work with your data more efficiently.

It is up to you which analysis you would like to perform with your data. I am available to support you and answer any questions you may have.

```{r}

# here I load all R packages that are part of the tidyverse collection of R packages
# you can use this instead of loading each package individually

library(tidyverse)

```

# Data import
